# Wallet Error Integration Guide

This guide maps each smart‑contract error defined in `contracts/src/errors.rs` to a consumer‑friendly message and usage example for wallet integrations (e.g., Freighter).

## Integration Walkthroughs
### 1. Handling errors in a Freighter wallet
```ts
import { ContractErrorDecoder } from "@xelma/contracts";

function handleError(error: any) {
  const code = error.result?.xdr?.value?.val?.code ?? 0;
  const message = ContractErrorDecoder(code);
  alert(message);
}
```

### 2. Displaying user‑friendly messages in a React UI
```tsx
import { ContractErrorDecoder } from "@xelma/contracts";

function ErrorBanner({code}: {code: number}) {
  return <div className="error">{ContractErrorDecoder(code)}</div>;
}
```

### 3. Unit testing error mapping
```ts
import { ContractErrorDecoder } from "@xelma/contracts";
import { expect } from "chai";

describe("ContractErrorDecoder", () => {
  it("maps known codes", () => {
    expect(ContractErrorDecoder(1)).to.equal("Contract already initialized.");
    expect(ContractErrorDecoder(22)).to.equal("Contract paused.");
  });
  it("handles unknown codes", () => {
    expect(ContractErrorDecoder(999)).to.match(/Unknown error/);
  });
});
```

### 4. Automated UI test with Selenium (JavaScript)
```js
await driver.findElement(By.id("betButton")).click();
await driver.wait(until.elementLocated(By.css(".error")));
const errorText = await driver.findElement(By.css(".error")).getText();
assert.include(errorText, "Insufficient balance");
```

### 5. Monitoring contract upgrades for documentation drift
Add the script `scripts/check-doc-drift.js` to your CI pipeline. If the script exits with a non‑zero status, the CI job fails, prompting a documentation update before merging.
