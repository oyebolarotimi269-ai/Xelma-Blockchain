# Xelma Contract — Canonical Event Schema

This document is the authoritative reference for all events emitted by the Xelma smart contract.
Indexers, explorers, and client libraries must use these definitions to avoid incompatible
field assumptions.

---

## Versioning strategy

Events are versioned by **schema version tag** in the documentation rather than on-chain.
Breaking field changes will increment the schema version and are announced in `MIGRATION.md`.
Additive changes (new optional events) do not increment the version.

Current schema version: **v1**

## Encoding conventions

| Field type   | On-chain encoding                                      |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `u32`        | Raw unsigned 32-bit integer                            |
| `u64`        | Raw unsigned 64-bit integer                            |
| `u128`       | Raw unsigned 128-bit integer                           |
| `i128`       | Raw signed 128-bit integer                             |
| `Address`    | Soroban `Address` (account or contract)                |
| `bool`       | Soroban boolean                                        |

**Amount units**: all token amounts are in stroops (1 vXLM = 10 000 000 stroops, 7 decimal places).

**Price units**: prices are scaled to **4 decimal places** (e.g., 0.2297 XLM → `2297`).

**Ledger sequence**: `u32` counter that increments with each Stellar ledger (~5 s/ledger).

**Timestamp**: Unix epoch seconds (`u64`), sourced from oracle payload or `env.ledger().timestamp()`.

---

## Topic encoding

Each event carries exactly **two topics**, both `Symbol` values.  
They form the canonical `(namespace, action)` pair used for filtering.

| 4        | `precision_payout_policy` | `u32` | Payout distribution policy used for Precision round: `0` = Equal, `1` = StakeWeighted |

---

Emitted exactly once per terminal round transition — competitive resolution,
admin cancellation, or min-participants fallback. Replaces the previously
separate `("round", "resolved")`, `("round", "cancelled")`, and
`("round", "fallback")` events.

This is the **canonical terminal round event**. Indexers should listen for
`("round", "summary")` and ignore legacy topic names.

The payload carries the full terminal state of the round:

| Position | Field               | Type         | Description                                                                 |
|----------|---------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0        | `version`           | `u32`        | Schema version tag (`0` for this layout). Reserved for future field changes. |
| 1        | `round_id`          | `u64`        | Monotonically increasing round identifier                                   |
| 2        | `status`            | `u32`        | Terminal status: `0` = Resolved, `1` = Cancelled, `2` = FallbackRefund, `3` = Voided |
| 3        | `mode`              | `u32`        | Round mode: `0` = UpDown, `1` = Precision                                   |
| 4        | `price_start`       | `u128`       | Opening price at round start (4 decimal places)                             |
| 5        | `price_final`       | `u128`       | Settlement price from oracle, or `0` for cancelled/fallback rounds           |
| 6        | `pool_up`           | `i128`       | Total Up-side pool at terminal time (stroops)                                |
| 7        | `pool_down`         | `i128`       | Total Down-side pool at terminal time (stroops)                              |
| 8        | `participant_count` | `u32`        | Total unique user participants                                               |
| 9        | `total_pot`         | `i128`       | Total accumulated round pot (stroops)                                        |
| 10       | `fee_amount`        | `i128`       | Protocol fees collected (stroops), `0` for non-competitive paths             |

| 12       | `confidence`        | `Option<u32>` | Oracle confidence in basis points (`None` for cancel / fallback; staged value for void) |

For dispute-enabled rounds, competitive settlement is staged before this
terminal summary is emitted. The archive status additionally uses `3` =
`Voided` when the permissionless refund path is selected.

### `("round", "pending")`

Emitted after a valid oracle result is staged and all payouts and protocol fees
are deferred for the configured dispute window.

| Position | Field                | Type   | Description                                      |
|----------|----------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 0        | `round_id`           | `u64`  | Round awaiting a terminal dispute decision       |

| 2        | `resolved_at_ledger` | `u32`  | Ledger where the oracle result was staged         |
| 3        | `deadline_ledger`    | `u32`  | First ledger where finalization is permitted      |

### `("round", "voided")`

Emitted when any caller voids a staged round strictly before its deadline. Each
participant is credited exactly their recorded stake and the protocol fee is
zero.

| Position | Field               | Type   | Description                              |
|----------|---------------------|--------|------------------------------------------|
| 0        | `round_id`          | `u64`  | Voided round                             |
| 1        | `participant_count` | `u32`  | Number of refunded participants          |
| 2        | `total_refund`      | `i128` | Sum of full-stake refunds in stroops      |

### `("round", "finalized")`

Emitted when any caller finalizes a staged round at or after its frozen
deadline. The standard settlement and fee policy has completed before emission.

| Position | Field               | Type   | Description                              |
|----------|---------------------|--------|------------------------------------------|
| 0        | `round_id`          | `u64`  | Finalized round                          |
| 1        | `final_price`       | `u128` | Staged oracle settlement price           |
| 2        | `participant_count` | `u32`  | Number of settled participants           |
| 3        | `fee_amount`        | `i128` | Protocol fee collected in stroops        |

Emitted once per participant during round resolution after that participant's settlement
outcome is known. Indexers can use these events to reconstruct the complete participant-level
result of a round without replaying contract storage reads.

| Position | Field          | Type      | Description                                               |
|----------|----------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 0        | `round_id`     | `u64`     | Round that produced the participant outcome               |
| 1        | `mode`         | `u32`     | Round mode: `0` = UpDown, `1` = Precision                 |
| 2        | `user`         | `Address` | Participant address                                       |
| 3        | `gross_payout` | `i128`    | Amount credited to pending winnings, in stroops           |
| 4        | `outcome_type` | `u32`     | `0` = win, `1` = loss, `2` = refund, `3` = void           |

`gross_payout` is `0` for losses. For refunds, it equals the participant's refunded stake.
For wins, it equals the full pending payout credited by the resolver, including returned
stake and any profit share.

---

### `("outcome", "loss")`

*Additive change added by Issue #168 — schema version stays at **v1**
(additive events do not trigger a version bump per the versioning policy
at the top of this file).*

Emitted per losing participant whenever a round settles competitively
(Issue #168).  Complements the implicit "winner" signal from pending-winnings
accumulation so that
analytics, user notifications, and indexers can detect losses without
inferring them from the absence of payout events.

The payload shape is unified across both modes; the `mode` field selects which
metadata field is meaningful:

- **UpDown mode (`mode = 0`):** `side` is the user's losing direction
  (`0` = Up, `1` = Down). `predicted_price` is fixed at `0`.
- **Precision mode (`mode = 1`):** `predicted_price` is the user's guess in the
  4-decimal price scale. `side` is fixed at `0`. Participants who only
  committed (and did not reveal) carry `predicted_price = 0` because the
  guess is unknowable on-chain until reveal.

Emitted for every participant who placed a bet/prediction and was on the
losing side of a competitive settlement. **Not** emitted for refund paths
(price-unchanged, one-sided pool, min-participants fallback, admin
cancellation, or Precision rounds where **nobody revealed** and all
commitments are refunded) — those cases use their respective refund
outcomes instead. When ≥1 Precision prediction is revealed, unrevealed
commitments forfeit to the pot and **do** emit this loss event
(`predicted_price = 0`).

| Position | Field            | Type      | Description                                                              |
|----------|------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0        | `user`           | `Address` | Address of the losing participant                                        |
| 1        | `round_id`       | `u64`     | Round the loss occurred in                                               |
| 2        | `mode`           | `u32`     | Round mode: `0` = UpDown, `1` = Precision                                |
| 3        | `amount`         | `i128`    | Stake amount the user committed (in stroops); the amount they lose       |
| 4        | `side`           | `u32`     | UpDown losing side (`0` = Up, `1` = Down). `0` for Precision mode        |
| 5        | `predicted_price`| `u128`    | Precision guess (4 decimal places). `0` for UpDown mode or unrevealed   |

---

### `("round", "cancelled")`

Emitted when an admin explicitly cancels an active round. All stakes are refunded.

| Position | Field       | Type   | Description                                             |
|----------|-------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| 0        | `round_id`  | `u64`  | Round that was cancelled                                |
| 1        | `reason`    | `u32`  | Admin-supplied reason code (application-defined)        |
| 2        | `pool_up`   | `i128` | Total Up-side pool at cancellation time (in stroops)    |
| 3        | `pool_down` | `i128` | Total Down-side pool at cancellation time (in stroops)  |

---

### `("round", "fallback")`

Emitted when a round ends below the configured minimum-participants threshold.
All stakes are refunded; no competitive settlement occurs.

| Position | Field               | Type  | Description                                         |

| 1        | `participant_count` | `u32` | Actual number of participants at resolution time    |
| 2        | `min_required`      | `u32` | Configured minimum that was not met                 |

---

### `("pool", "onesided")`

Emitted when a prediction round settles as a one-sided (degenerate) market (Issue #270).
Triggered when bets/predictions were placed on only one side (e.g., UP only or DOWN only).
Applies the configured deterministic settlement policy (`OneSidedPolicy::Refund` default).

| Position | Field            | Type   | Description                                                              |

---


### `("config", "updated")`

Emitted for every admin configuration mutation when a value is actually written, including immediate setters and timelocked changes when they are applied. This is the canonical audit event for reconstructing configuration history from events alone.

| Position | Field       | Type                  | Description                                      |

Example payload for a windows update: `(Windows, Windows(6, 12), Windows(10, 20))`.

`ConfigChangeKind` values currently include `Windows`, `MaxStake`, `MaxUserRoundExposure`, `MaxPendingWinnings`, `OracleStaleThreshold`, `OracleMaxDeviationBps`, `ProtocolFeeBps`, `MinParticipants`, `MaxPrecisionParticipants`, `MintLimit`, `ArchiveRetention`, `CloseBufferLedgers`, and `OracleQuorum`.

---

#### `("action", "rejct")` — Diagnostic rejected-action event (Issue #196)

Emitted when a privileged action (admin or oracle) is rejected due to an
auth failure, paused contract, invalid state, or validation error. Enables
operators to diagnose failed privileged transactions from on-chain events
without relying on off-chain error logs.

**Privacy**: the payload contains only the `actor` Address, an `action`
Symbol, and a numeric `reason` code (a `ContractError` variant). No
personally identifiable information, financial amounts, or internal state
is exposed. Operators can match reason codes against the `ContractError`
enum variants in `contracts/src/errors.rs`.

| Position | Field    | Type      | Description                                                        |
|----------|----------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0        | `actor`  | `Address` | Address of the authenticated caller whose action was rejected       |
| 1        | `action` | `Symbol`  | Short name of the privileged action (e.g. `"create"`, `"resolve"`) |
| 2        | `reason` | `u32`     | Numeric error code matching a `ContractError` variant               |

**Example action symbols**: `"create"`, `"resolve"`, `"cancel"`, `"migrate"`,
`"withdraw"`, `"hbeat"`, `"arm_ovr"`, `"set_arch"`, `"sched"`,
`"cncl_cfg"`, `"min_par"`, `"max_prec"`, `"mint_lim"`.

**Reason codes** are the integer values of `ContractError` — see
`contracts/src/errors.rs`.

## `("oracle", "multisum")` — Multi-feed settlement summary (Issue #262)

Emitted when `resolve_round_multi` successfully computes the median price and
passes quorum. Provides a compact summary of the multi-feed resolution before
round settlement proceeds.

| Position | Field               | Type   | Description                                               |

| 3        | `median_price`      | `u128` | Computed median settlement price (4 decimal places)       |
| 4        | `quorum_threshold`  | `u32`  | Configured quorum threshold that was satisfied            |

---

## `("oracle", "nofed")` — Multi-feed quorum failure (Issue #262)

Emitted when `resolve_round_multi` fails because too few observations survived
outlier rejection to meet the configured quorum threshold.

| Position | Field               | Type   | Description                                               |

---

## `("oracle", "quorum")` — Quorum config updated (Issue #262)

Emitted when the admin sets or clears the multi-feed oracle quorum
configuration. Emitted both via the direct setter and via timelocked config
application.

| Position | Field                  | Type   | Description                                               |
|----------|------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|

| 1        | `quorum_threshold`     | `u32`  | Minimum surviving observations for quorum (0 if cleared)  |
| 2        | `outlier_threshold_bps`| `u32`  | Max deviation from median before outlier rejection        |

---

## `("oracle", "heartbeat")`

Emitted when the oracle records an on-chain liveness heartbeat.

| Position | Field       | Type  | Description                                                  |

---

## Oracle rotation events (two-step with mandatory delay)

Oracle rotation uses a two-step flow with a **mandatory 1-hour delay**
(`MIN_ROTATION_DELAY_SECONDS = 3_600`) between proposal and acceptance.
This prevents quiet takeovers — even with admin key compromise, operators
have a full hour to observe the proposal and react.

### `("oracle", "propose")`

Emitted when the admin proposes a new oracle address with an expiry window.

| Position | Field         | Type      | Description                                            |

| 1        | `expires_at`  | `u64`     | Unix timestamp when the proposal expires               |

### `("oracle", "accept")`

Emitted when a pending rotation proposal is successfully accepted (after the
mandatory delay has elapsed and before expiry).

| Position | Field             | Type      | Description                               |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------|
| 0        | `previous_oracle` | `Address` | Oracle address before the rotation         |
| 1        | `new_oracle`      | `Address` | New oracle address after the rotation      |

### `("oracle", "cancel")`

Emitted when the admin cancels a pending rotation proposal.

| Position | Field         | Type      | Description                                      |
|----------|---------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 0        | `new_oracle`  | `Address` | The proposed oracle address that was cancelled    |

### `("oracle", "expired")`

Emitted when an expired proposal is cleaned up (auto-clean in
`get_oracle_rotation_proposal` or during `accept_oracle_rotation`).

| Position | Field         | Type  | Description                                      |
|----------|---------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 0        | `new_oracle`  | `Address` | The proposed oracle address that expired       |
| 1        | `proposed_at` | `u64` | Unix timestamp when the proposal was created      |
| 2        | `expires_at`  | `u64` | Unix timestamp when the proposal expired          |

### `("oracle", "early")`

Emitted when an attempt to accept a rotation proposal is rejected because the
mandatory delay (`MIN_ROTATION_DELAY_SECONDS`) has not yet elapsed.

| Position | Field           | Type  | Description                                          |
|----------|-----------------|-------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 0        | `new_oracle`    | `Address` | The proposed oracle address                       |
| 1        | `current_ts`    | `u64` | Current ledger timestamp at rejection time            |
| 2        | `earliest_accept` | `u64` | Timestamp at which acceptance will be allowed       |

---

|----------|------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0        | `old_mode` | `u32` | Previous runtime mode: `0` = Normal, `1` = ClaimsOnly, `2` = Paused |
| 1        | `new_mode` | `u32` | New runtime mode: `0` = Normal, `1` = ClaimsOnly, `2` = Paused      |

## Example decode mappings

### JavaScript / TypeScript example: filter for losses

```typescript
import { xdr, scValToNative } from "@stellar/stellar-sdk";

function decodeOutcomeLoss(contractEvent: xdr.DiagnosticEvent) {
  const topics = contractEvent.event().body().v0().topics();
  const ns = scValToNative(topics[0]);
  const action = scValToNative(topics[1]);
  if (ns !== "outcome" || action !== "loss") return null;
  const data = scValToNative(contractEvent.event().body().v0().data());
  // [user, round_id, mode, amount, side, predicted_price]
  return { type: "loss", ...data };
}
```

---

### JavaScript / TypeScript (Stellar SDK)

```typescript
import { xdr, scValToNative } from "@stellar/stellar-sdk";

function decodeEvent(contractEvent: xdr.DiagnosticEvent) {
  const topics = contractEvent.event().body().v0().topics();
  const ns = scValToNative(topics[0]) as string;    // e.g. "round"
  const action = scValToNative(topics[1]) as string; // e.g. "created"
  const data = scValToNative(contractEvent.event().body().v0().data());
  return { ns, action, data };
}
```

### Rust (soroban-sdk test utilities)

```rust
use soroban_sdk::{symbol_short, testutils::{Events, TryIntoVal}, Env};

let events = env.events().all();
let resolved = events.iter().find(|(_, topics, _)| {
    topics.get(0).and_then(|t| t.try_into_val(&env).ok()) == Some(symbol_short!("round"))
        && topics.get(1).and_then(|t| t.try_into_val(&env).ok()) == Some(symbol_short!("summary"))
});
```

## `("protocol", "fee_coll")` — Competitive-settlement fee accrual

Emitted by every competitive-settlement path (UpDown indexed/legacy, Precision
indexed/legacy) when the protocol fee is enabled (Issue #162). NOT emitted on
refund / cancel / fallback paths — those return users' full stake and the
treasury stays flat.

| Field              | Type          | Description                                                          |
|--------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `round_id`         | `u64`         | The id of the settled round.                                          |
| `fee_amount`       | `i128`        | Stroops routed to the on-chain treasury this round.                   |
| `treasury_balance` | `i128`        | Cumulative treasury balance AFTER this round's credit.                |
| `bps_active`       | `u32`         | The fee's bps that produced `fee_amount` (echoes storage).            |
| `fee_model`        | `u32`         | Fee incidence model: `0` = FeeOnPot, `1` = FeeOnWinnings (Issue #268).|

**Topics**: `("protocol", "fee_coll")`
**Source contracts**: `VirtualTokenContract`
**Emitted by**: `_record_winnings_indexed`, `_record_winnings_legacy`,
`_resolve_precision_mode`, `_resolve_precision_legacy`.

The conservation invariant
`Σ payout_i + fee_amount == total_pot` holds for every emission. In the
UpDown pathological case `fee > losing_pool` (very thin losing-side
liquidity near the bps cap, FeeOnPot model only) the spillover is deducted
from `winning_pool` so the invariant still holds and winners receive only
their residual principal — documented inline in `_apply_protocol_fee_updown`.

Under `FeeOnWinnings` (Issue #268) the fee is calculated only on the net
profit (losing_pool in UpDown; pot - winner_stakes in Precision), so
winners always retain their full principal and the spillover guard is never
triggered.

---

## `("protocol", "fee_bps_set")` — Timelocked fee schedule applied

Emitted exactly once when a previously-scheduled `ProtocolFeeBps` change
passes its `activation_ledger` and is written to storage (Issue #162).

| Field   | Type          | Description                                              |
|---------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `bps`   | `Option<u32>` | New fee (None = fee disabled; Some(bps) = active).       |

**Topics**: `("protocol", "fee_bps_set")`
**Source contracts**: `VirtualTokenContract`
**Emitted by**: `_apply_config_payload` arm for `ConfigChangeKind::ProtocolFeeBps`.

---

## `("protocol", "fee_withdrawn")` — Treasury drain to recipient

Emitted when the admin drains accumulated fees to an on-chain recipient
(Issue #162). Recipient receives the credited amount through the existing
`PendingWinnings` → `claim_winnings` flow used by competitive payouts and
refunds, so no new authorization surface is added.

| Field           | Type     | Description                                              |
|-----------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `recipient`     | `Address`| The credited account.                                    |
| `amount`        | `i128`   | Stroops transferred out of the treasury this call.       |
| `new_treasury`  | `i128`   | Treasury balance after withdrawal.                       |

**Topics**: `("protocol", "fee_withdrawn")`
**Source contracts**: `VirtualTokenContract`
**Emitted by**: `withdraw_protocol_fee`.

---

## `("template", "set")` — Round template stored

Emitted when the admin stores or overwrites the round-creation blueprint
used by `create_next_from_template`.

| Field         | Type          | Description                                    |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `start_price` | `u128`        | Starting price the next round will use.         |
| `mode`        | `u32`         | Round mode: `0` = UpDown, `1` = Precision.       |

**Topics**: `("template", "set")`
**Source contracts**: `VirtualTokenContract`
**Emitted by**: `set_round_template`.

---

## `("template", "cleared")` — Round template removed

Emitted when the admin clears the configured round template.

|-----------|-------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `ledger`  | `u32` | Ledger sequence number at which it was cleared.|

**Topics**: `("template", "cleared")`
**Source contracts**: `VirtualTokenContract`
**Emitted by**: `clear_round_template`.

---

## `("template", "applied")` — Next round created from template

Emitted when `create_next_from_template` successfully creates a round from
the stored blueprint. Always accompanied by a `("round", "created")` event
from the underlying `create_round` call.

| Field         | Type   | Description                                   |
|---------------|--------|------------------------------------------------|
| `round_id`    | `u64`  | Id of the newly created round.                  |
| `start_price` | `u128` | Starting price used (from the template).        |
| `mode`        | `u32`  | Round mode used: `0` = UpDown, `1` = Precision. |

**Topics**: `("template", "applied")`
**Source contracts**: `VirtualTokenContract`
**Emitted by**: `create_next_from_template`.

---

## `("season", "reset")` — Leaderboard season archived and advanced

Emitted when the admin resets the active leaderboard season. The ending
season's bounded rankings are frozen into a permanent `SeasonArchive` before
the season id advances; per-user season stats (`SeasonUserStats`) for the
ended season are never deleted and remain independently queryable.

| Field               | Type  | Description                                          |
|---------------------|-------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `season_id`         | `u32` | Id of the season that was just archived.               |

| `ended_at_ledger`    | `u32` | Ledger sequence number at which the season ended.       |
| `participant_count` | `u32` | Distinct addresses present in the archived rankings.    |

**Topics**: `("season", "reset")`
**Source contracts**: `VirtualTokenContract`
**Emitted by**: `reset_leaderboard_season`.
**Golden test**: `tests::event_order_golden::golden_season_reset_*`.

## Governance events (dual approval, Issue #272)

All governance events use topic0 `"gov"`. Payload fields are positional and
pinned by `tests::event_order_golden` (Issue #568): adding, removing or
reordering a field is a breaking change for indexers.

`action_code` values: `0` PauseProtocol, `1` UnpauseProtocol,
`2` SetProtocolFeeBps, `3` WithdrawProtocolFee, `4` SetTreasuryAddress,
`5` SetAdmin, `6` SetOracle, `7` WithdrawInsuranceFund,
`8` SetInsuranceSplitBps, `9` SetInsuranceCoverageBps.

### `("gov", "appr_set")` — Secondary approver configured

| Position | Field      | Type      |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| 0        | `admin`    | `Address` |
| 1        | `approver` | `Address` |

**Emitted by**: `set_gov_approver`.

### `("gov", "proposed")` — Proposal created

| Position | Field               | Type      | Description                                                   |

| 1        | `proposer`          | `Address` | Admin or approver who proposed.                               |
| 2        | `action_code`       | `u32`     | See table above.                                              |
| 3        | `expires_at_ledger` | `u32`     | `created_at_ledger + ttl`; `ttl` is `custom_ttl` or `get_gov_proposal_ttl()`. |

**Emitted by**: `propose_gov_action`.

### `("gov", "approved")` — Proposal approved

| Position | Field         | Type      |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| 0        | `proposal_id` | `u64`     |
| 1        | `approver`    | `Address` |

**Emitted by**: `approve_gov_proposal`.

### `("gov", "executed")` — Proposal executed

| Position | Field         | Type      |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| 0        | `proposal_id` | `u64`     |
| 1        | `executor`    | `Address` |
| 2        | `action_code` | `u32`     |

Always the **last** event of `execute_gov_proposal`. Side-effect events of the
action are emitted first, in the same invocation; e.g. `PauseProtocol` /
`UnpauseProtocol` emit `("mode", "transition")` immediately before `executed`.

### `("gov", "cancel")` — Proposal cancelled

| Position | Field         | Type      |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| 0        | `proposal_id` | `u64`     |
| 1        | `canceller`   | `Address` |

**Emitted by**: `cancel_gov_proposal` (from `Pending`, `Approved` or `Expired`).

### `("gov", "expired")` — Proposal found expired

| Position | Field            | Type  |
|----------|------------------|-------|
| 0        | `proposal_id`    | `u64` |
| 1        | `current_ledger` | `u32` |

Published by `approve_gov_proposal` / `execute_gov_proposal` right before they
return `ProposalExpired`. Because the call fails, the host rolls the event
back, so **it never reaches the ledger** today. Indexers should derive expiry
from `expires_at_ledger` in `("gov", "proposed")` instead.

## `("storage", "touch")` — Batch TTL extension

| Position | Field     | Type  | Description                                                   |
|----------|-----------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0        | `touched` | `u32` | Allowlisted keys that existed and had their TTL extended.     |
| 1        | `skipped` | `u32` | Allowlisted keys that were absent from storage (no-op).       |

Emitted once per successful call, including an empty batch (`(0, 0)`).
A non-allowlisted key aborts the call, so no `touch` event is emitted.

**Emitted by**: `batch_touch_ttl`.
**Golden test**: `tests::event_order_golden::golden_storage_touch_*`.

## `("oracle", "hblocked")` — Heartbeat health gate blocked settlement

Emitted when `resolve_round` is blocked by the heartbeat health gate in strict mode
(Issue #264). The round remains active; the oracle or admin must address the heartbeat
state before retrying.

| Position | Field       | Type   | Description                                    |
|----------|-------------|--------|------------------------------------------------|
| 0        | `round_id`  | `u64`  | Round id that was blocked from settlement       |

**Topics**: `("oracle", "hblocked")`
**Source contracts**: `VirtualTokenContract`
**Emitted by**: `resolve_round` (heartbeat health gate, strict mode).

---

## `("oracle", "hoverride")` — Heartbeat health gate override consumed

Emitted when the admin-armed heartbeat health override is consumed during
`resolve_round`, allowing settlement to proceed past the gate (Issue #264).

| Position | Field       | Type   | Description                                    |
|----------|-------------|--------|------------------------------------------------|
| 0        | `round_id`  | `u64`  | Round id for which the override was consumed    |

**Topics**: `("oracle", "hoverride")`
**Source contracts**: `VirtualTokenContract`
**Emitted by**: `resolve_round` (heartbeat health gate override path).
